## List of Projects:

1. **[Online Bookstore Database](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_1)**

    Create a robust database (`OnlineBookStore`) for managing an online bookstore. Tables include `books`, `authors`, `customers`, `orders`, and `reviews`. Implement essential **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and tackle complex queries.


2. **[Employee Management System](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_2)**

    Develop a robust database system (`EmployeeManagementSystem`) for managing employee records. The database encompasses six key tables, including `employees`, `departments`, `positions`, `employee_position` (linking employees to positions), `employee_department` (linking employees to departments) & `employee_manager`.



3. **[Inventory Management System](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_3):**

    Design and implement a comprehensive database system (`InventoryManagementSystem`) for efficient inventory tracking in a store. The database includes tables for `product`, `category`, `supplier`, `customer`, and `sale`. Develop features for inventory management, such as product additions, stock updates, and sales transactions. Implement relationships between entities to ensure accurate tracking of product details and supplier information.



4. **[Banking System](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_4):**

    Develop a comprehensive database (`BankingSystem`) for managing banking operations, encompassing tables for `customers`, `accounts`, `transactions`, and `balances`. Implement features that facilitate depositing, withdrawing, and account management functionalities, ensuring a robust and secure system for efficient banking operations.




5. **[Movie Bank Database](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_5):**

6. **[Social Media Database](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_6):**

   Create a simple (`SocialMediaDatabase`) with tables for `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `groups_`, `likes`, `admins`, `accounts`, `friendship`, `messages`, `group_members` and `notifications`. Each table stores important information in different columns, which can be linked to each other via foreign keys in each table.




7. **[E-commerce Database](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_7):**

   Develop a database (`ECommerce`) for an e-commerce platform, covering `products`, `users`, `orders`, `categories`, `product_category`, `order_items` and `reviews`. Build features for product listings, cart management, and order processing.



8. **[Event Management System](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/SQL_MiniProjects/tree/systembiology/project_8):**
